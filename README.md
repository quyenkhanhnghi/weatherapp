# Weather App

Developed a dynamic Weather App that retrieves real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This user-friendly application allows users to check the current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts for their desired locations (name of the city). Leveraging my programming skills and API integration expertise, I created an intuitive interface that provides seamless access to up-to-date weather information. The project showcases my ability to work with external APIs, handle data processing, and deliver a practical solution for users seeking weather updates on-the-go.
